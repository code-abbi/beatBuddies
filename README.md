1.  **Fork & Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/beatBuddies.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/beatBuddies.git)
    cd beatBuddies
    ```

2.  **Set up Backend Environment Variables:**
    -   Navigate to the `backend` folder: `cd backend`
    -   Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.sample`.
    -   Fill in the following variables:

    | Variable                | Description                                                |
    | :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `PORT`                  | The port for the backend server (e.g., `8000`).            |
    | `MONGODB_URI`           | Your connection string from MongoDB Atlas.                 |
    | `ADMIN_EMAIL`           | The email address that will have admin privileges.         |

    | `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Your Publishable Key from Clerk.dev.                       |
    | `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`      | Your Secret Key from Clerk.dev.                            |

3.  **Set up Frontend Environment Variables:**
    -   Navigate to the `frontend` folder: `cd ../frontend`
    -   Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.sample`.
    -   Fill in the following variables:

    | Variable                  | Description                                            |
    | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- |
    | `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Your **same** Publishable Key from Clerk.dev.        |
    | `VITE_API_URL`              | The full URL to your backend API (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/api`). |


4.  **Install Dependencies for both frontend and backend:**
    -   From the **root** of the project, run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
    This command will automatically install dependencies for both the `frontend` and `backend` directories.


5.  **Seed the Database:**
    -   Your database is currently empty. Navigate to the `backend` folder and run the seed scripts to populate it with sample data:
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    npm run seed:songs
    npm run seed:albums
    ```

6.  **Run the Application:**
    -   You will need two separate terminals.
    -   **In Terminal 1 (for the backend):**
        ```bash
        cd backend
        npm run dev
        ```
    -   **In Terminal 2 (for the frontend):**
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm run dev
        ```

Your application should now be running locally! The frontend will typically be on `http://localhost:5173`.
